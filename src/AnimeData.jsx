      "So I've always been a huge fan of Bleach, and this very obviously takes a lot of influence from it. I started watching this show when the first season was halfway done. At first I appreciated how fast everything was happening. One thing about older animes is always the fking pacing bro. This show has no fat, all lean meat. The opening is most viewed anime opening for a reason. I tuned in to see the hype and I'm so glad I did. Bro every character is so fucking cool. When Gojo took off his blindfold I was ready to play for the other team. When the school tournament arc was taking place I was watching every week. THIS SHOW DID NOT MISS. Every week it only got better and better. Friday at 3pm I ordered my lil sushi and hussled my ass back to my dorm room to watch this shit. Somedays I was so amazed by everything I rewatched the epsiode right then and there. Once it finished I couldn't believe how good it was. I couldn't believe an anime that only had 24 episodes at the time was making me reconsider what my #1 anime of all time was. I fking anime that just came out is making me reconsider whether it was better than something I had cherished for almost 20 years of my life. Then I heard about the Shibuya arc. Bro. I fought tooth and nail to not read the manga, to avoid the spoilers, to hold out but my will power wasn't strong enough. I read the manga and caught up. Bro. Easily numba 1. Shibuya is a top 3 arc ever. These mfers throwing hands like crazy, they really massacred ma boy Yuji. Then the culling games arc was so fking tough and you think it's hard to top and then the author pulls one of the greatest plot twists in fking history bro. Now we got (spoiler alert) Gojo, the strongest sorcer of today vs Sukuna the king of curses. Bro I stay up every wednesday night to read the fking leaks and its like I'm watching a UFC fight. This anime is so unreal, so cool, and Todo is the most poetic chad I've ever scene. I pray for my boy mister Yuji 'left right goodnight' Itadori.",

      "The OG. The first. When Naruto was a little kid, I was watching as a little kid. I watched Shippuden when I was 17. This show was just such a strong part of my life. There is a reason why it's my number 2. Naruto is such a top MC it's unreal, the literal definiton of 'never back down never what?'. The Pain arc had me rethinking life. Madara made me realize what a real villain is. The man asked if he wanted his clones with Susano or not. A fking dog bro that man is him. Sasuke stabbing Karin just to get through to his opp. This show has such unreal moments and it just means so much to me that it can't be taken away from the number 2 spot, although One Piece and this show are basically both my number 2s. I will always love it even with its many flaws. ",

      "Wow. I used to see the end of this anime's episodes when I was a kid waiting for Naruto to air. For the longest time I had only watched Naruto and didn't open my eyes to considering watching a 1000 episode anime. The only reason I started is because on of my best friends started it and that lil bitch can't beat me so I had to pass him. If only I had started it sooner. This anime is so beautiful and so great that I understand why this is so popular all around the world. Enies Lobby really put it in my top 5. The show also helped me during a rought time and the G8 filler was the perfect thing to help me lift my mood. It's crazy to think that when I was at the 300 episode mark, I would get sad thinking that one day, I'll be done with this show. Just watching the Strawhats interact is what makes this show so amazing. Chopper a top 2 raccoon and he ain't number 2. ",

      "Such an interesting anime. Growing up as a child, I was always a fan of Samurai Jack, The Clone Wars(2003), shows that don't have a lot of dialogue in the most intense moments. This show is very similar in that aspect. The coolest moments are honestly when everyone is silent, the music is hitting, and we just hear the clashing of the EVAs and the Angels. The movie really solidified its position in the top 5, such a crazy fight scene with Asuka and the Angels is one of my top 5 fight scenes ever. Depression and sadness.",

      "The better version of Death Note in my opinion. Watching Lelouch scheme his plans was so enjoyable, and the reveals really had me on the edge of my seat. There is one specific scene in the middle of the show that really had my guts twisting. I don't think any other anime has as perfect an ending as this one. An amazing mecha anime I could recommend to most.",

      "The switch up from season 1 to season 2 was such an interesting choice, but after looking at the show as a whole and the theme of it, it is beautiful. Anybody that watches this show just for the fights doesn't deserve it. The plot really is amazing. Watching season 2, the emotions and thoughts it invokes make you question a lot of things, like why does strength have to amount to only physical strength? The second season made me want to become a better person. I have no enemies. ",

      "This may catch a lot of people of guard but for me personally, this belongs in the top 10. I grew up playing sports, mainly competing in rowing during highschool. This brought back so many memories and feelings; winning, losing, camaraderie. Those last second points and the game winning points really bring out the emotions and you can't help but root for every single player on any team. If you grew up competitive, this is a great anime to watch.  ",

      "This became so popular and mainstream for a reason. I watched this when it first came out and I almost didn't like it because it made me sick just knowing any episode my favorite character is biting the dust. The plot twists are out of this world. This show completely broke the mold for a lot of animes, and it deserves the crown as one of the greatest animes of all time. I tell anyone thats interested in anime that this is a strong start, and whether they like anime or not this is a top ten show ever. Sublime.",

I read the manga and when the final arc becomes animated, this will definitely be a top 5 anime for anyone that watches shonen anime.",

This was the first time I had read manga before watching an anime and it was unbelievable. The manga already had me so invested because Denji really is just one of us. Then when the anime came out they did it so much fking justice it looked so amazing. I cannot wait for them to animate all of it. ",

One time I was watching it on the train and the second episode came on and thank god I had a privacy screen protector at the time. Once I rewatched it I realized how intriguing it was and made me realize how much I enjoyed it.",

Netero vs Meruem was a top tier fight, and Gons transformation and the scene where Killua finds him is beautiful. A truly amazing anime.",

The emotions whenever a fight goes down and someone makes a comeback to beat the villains is just unreal. Top 3 scenes gotta be Lemillion saving Eri, United States of Smash, and when Stain put the fear in Deku.",

The manga started off strong, but I felt the animation was lacking in fights and I dropped it. Probably belongs further down but I'm too lazy to actually move it down.",

This list is based on my enjoyment, and I really did love the story but I to me I just was watching a good story. With anime, I want to be able to feel something or be able to jump out of my chair in excitement or some shit like that, but I just felt like I was watching a regular TV show. Maybe I watched it too fast too. Who knows, but I def enjoyed the other animes ahead of it much more at the time of watching them.",

Unfortunately I heard that season 2 sucked ass, so I didn't even bother watching. One day I was with my girlfriend in a library and I decided to read the manga and it was so good. If onyl they were properly able to animate the entire thing. I feel it would have been a top 20 anime for everyone",
